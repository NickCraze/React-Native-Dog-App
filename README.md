# React-Native-Dog-App
This mobile app, built with React Native, Redux, TypeScript, and styled using NativeWind and TailwindCSS, provides an interactive experience for users to explore information about various dog breeds. The app features a user authentication system and fetches data from the Dog API to display random images and breed information throughout the app.
