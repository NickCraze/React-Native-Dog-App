# React-Native-Dog-App
React Native Dog App 🐕📱

This mobile application, built with React Native, Redux, TypeScript, and styled using NativeWind and TailwindCSS, provides an interactive experience for users to explore information about various dog breeds. The app features a user authentication system and fetches data from the Dog API to display random images and breed information throughout the app.

Key functionalities include:

User Authentication: Securely log in users to access the app.
Dog API Integration: Fetch and display random dog images and breed details from the Dog API.
Global State Management: Utilize Redux for efficient state management across the app.
Modern Styling: TailwindCSS and NativeWind for responsive, consistent, and sleek UI design.
This project showcases the integration of key mobile development practices such as authentication, API fetching, and state management, all within a TypeScript and React Native environment.
